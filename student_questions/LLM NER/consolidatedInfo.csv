 Punishment
 Security legislation, in particular the Internal Security Act,
 allows police considerable latitude and generally unsupervised
 discretion in the arrest and detention of suspects, and in the
 interrogation of detainees. Lengthy periods of detention,
 during which authorities are not obliged by law to present
 formal charges, are a frequent occurrence and offer
 considerable potential for police abuse of detainees. Some
 persons detained under the state of emergency have presented
 affidavits to the effect that they were tortured while in
 police detention. The types of torture alleged include:
 beatings, eardrum perforations, whippings, forced ingestion of
 foreign substances including gasoline and human hair, and the
 application of electrical shocks to genitals. In September,
 the South African Supreme Court (South Eastern Cape local
 division), acting on the affidavit of a prison physician,
 found reason to enjoin police in the Port Elizabeth area from
 assaulting state of emergency detainees. Denis Neer, General
 Secretary of the Motor Assembly and Component Workers Union of
 South Africa (MACWUSA), an affiliate of the UDF, won a
 restraining order against police after he had been assaulted
 while detained under the state of emergency regulations.
 Provisions indemnifying law enforcement officials from both
 criminal and civil liability for acts undertaken in enforcing
 the state of emergency are cited by some human rights
 activists and other observers as giving police the impression
 that they have license to engage in abusive conduct.
